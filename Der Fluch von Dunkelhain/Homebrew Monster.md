**Dark Devotion**: The Fanatic has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

**Spellcasting**: The Fanatic is a 5th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). The Fanatic has the following cleric spells prepared:

- **Cantrips** (at will): guidance, sacred flame, thaumaturgy
- **1st level** (4 slots): command, inflict wounds, shield of faith
- **2nd level** (3 slots): hold person, spiritual weapon
- **3rd level** (2 slots): bestow curse, spirit guardians

**Fanatical Command** (One Time Use). The Fanatic targets one creature it can see within 30 ft. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the Fanatic for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A charmed target must use its action on its next turn to attack a creature of the Fanatic’s choice other than itself.

**Phase 1: Fanatical Zeal (Recharge 5–6)** 
As a bonus action when the Fanatic is reduced to half its hit points or fewer for the first time, it enters a zealous phase until the end of its next turn. During this phase:

- Its speed increases to 40 ft.
- It regains 13 (2d8 + 4) hit points.
- Its spiritual weapon and spirit guardians deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage on a hit or in the area.  
    At the end of this phase, it can repeat the effect if it recharges.

**Phase 2: Blessing of Tyranny** 
When  the Fanatic is reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, Bane grants it this blessing as a reaction (lasts until  the Fanatic is defeated or 3 rounds pass). During this phase:

-  The Fanatic gains 10 temporary hit points.
- Its melee attacks deal an extra 2 necrotic damage.
- As an action (1/round),  the Fanatic activates Aura of Fear: “ the Fanatic raises his amulet, and a wave of fear washes over you, as if Bane’s gaze crushes you down!” Each creature within 10 ft. must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn (can’t move toward  the Fanatic and has disadvantage on attack rolls). On a success, the creature is immune to this aura for 24 hours.

**Multiattack**.  The Fanatic makes two attacks: one with its scimitar and one with its dagger or a cantrip.

**Scimitar**. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

**Dagger**. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.

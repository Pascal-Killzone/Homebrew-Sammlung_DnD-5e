# Cult Fanatic Lord

Medium humanoid (human), chaotic evil

## Desciption

A Cult Fanatic Lord is a zealous leader of a dark sect, consumed by devotion to a malevolent deity like Bane, Lord of Tyranny. Clad in tattered robes adorned with profane sigils and a pulsing, unholy amulet, their gaunt frame and burning eyes exude menace. Once an ordinary soul—perhaps a fallen priest or desperate outcast—they embraced their god’s promises after a vision or tragedy, rising through ruthless charisma to command a cult. They seek to spread their deity’s dominion, converting or destroying opposition, and aim to establish a stronghold for unholy rituals. With commanding presence and divine favor, they wield blade and spell to impose tyranny, their chilling voice swaying followers and terrifying foes.

## Bonus Actions

**Fanatical Command** (One Time Use):
The Fanatic targets one creature it can see within 30 ft. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the Fanatic for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A charmed target must use its action on its next turn to attack a creature of the Fanatic’s choice other than itself.

**Aura of Fear** (1/round): 
The Fanatic raises his amulet, and a wave of fear washes over you, as if Bane’s gaze crushes you down!” Each creature within 15 ft. must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, the creature is immune to this aura for 24 hours.

**Fanatical Zeal (Recharge 5–6)**

- Its speed increases to 40 ft.
- It regains 13 (2d6 + 4) hit points.
- Its spiritual weapon and spirit guardians deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage on a hit or in the area.  
    At the end of this phase, it can repeat the effect if it recharges.
